Here’s something that’s really working for me in organic. Thought I’d share. 

When someone reaches out to me after seeing one of my lives or posts: 

1. What I do: <br>
I have a convo with them and use snippets of voice. They always say how nice it is to hear my voice. It works because it’s more like a real conversation. They have reached out, so are receptive to learning more about me. In a way, we have permission to do that. Voice is a higher resonance than text. And the bonus is that if you are a terrible texter (as I am) speaking is just easier. And people like this because it saves the back and forthing of slow texts. And then they leave voices. Now it’s a real conversation. 

2. What I don’t do: <br>
I don’t reach out to people cold and leave long voice messages (yes, I was getting a spate of these). This doesn’t work because we don’t know that person who has appeared and are expected to listen to a minute of a “how’s the weather over there, followed by info on who they are, how they are going to help me with my mindset or xyz. This is a burden. An anti-sell. And it’s presumptuous that we are expected to stop everything to listen. 

Voice is wonderful. Use it well. 

Have a great day!
